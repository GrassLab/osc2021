New ASCII Format
     The "new" ASCII format uses 8-byte	hexadecimal fields for all numbers and
     separates device numbers into separate fields for major and minor num-
     bers.

	   struct cpio_newc_header {
		   char	   c_magic[6];
		   char	   c_ino[8];
		   char	   c_mode[8];
		   char	   c_uid[8];
		   char	   c_gid[8];
		   char	   c_nlink[8];
		   char	   c_mtime[8];
		   char	   c_filesize[8];
		   char	   c_devmajor[8];
		   char	   c_devminor[8];
		   char	   c_rdevmajor[8];
		   char	   c_rdevminor[8];
		   char	   c_namesize[8];
		   char	   c_check[8];
	   };

     Except as specified below,	the fields here	match those specified for the
     old binary	format above.

     magic   The string	"070701".

     check   This field	is always set to zero by writers and ignored by	read-
	     ers.  See the next	section	for more details.

     The pathname is followed by NUL bytes so that the total size of the fixed
     header plus pathname is a multiple	of four.  Likewise, the	file data is
     padded to a multiple of four bytes.  Note that this format	supports only
     4 gigabyte	files (unlike the older	ASCII format, which supports 8 giga-
     byte files).

     In	this format, hardlinked	files are handled by setting the filesize to
     zero for each entry except	the first one that appears in the archive.
